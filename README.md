# GitHub Repo: Unsupervised Machine Learning to Detect Impending Anomalies in Testing of Fuel Economy and Emissions of Light-Duty Vehicles

This is the repo for the datasets and codes on the paper testing the use of unsupervised machine learning on car fuel economy and emissions dataset for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) model years 2015 to 2023 from US-EPA.

The datasets can be accessed through this URL: https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy

The working clean datasets used in the paper for this work are in the folder "Working Datasets" while the raw data downloaded from US-EPA are in the folder "Raw US-EPA files" in this repo.
